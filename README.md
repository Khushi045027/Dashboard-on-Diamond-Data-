### About Data 
The dataset includes key attributes of diamonds, such as **cut**, which describes the diamond's shape and craftsmanship; **color**, graded from D (clear) to Z (yellowish); **clarity**, indicating internal inclusions or flaws; and **carat weight**, representing the mass of the diamond. **Cut quality** is based on the GIA Cut Grading System, and diamonds are graded by **lab** (e.g., GIA, IGI). **Eye-clean** refers to whether inclusions are visible to the naked eye. **Total sales price** indicates the price of the diamond in dollars.

### Questions for this dataset
1. What is the trend of cut preferences among diamonds, and why is the round cut the most popular?
2. How does carat weight distribution affect diamond sales, and why do lower carat weights dominate the market?
3. What percentage of eye-clean diamonds are certified by labs, and why is GIA the most preferred certification authority?
4. How do cut and clarity distributions differ across different labs, and why does GIA dominate the certification market for high-clarity diamonds?
5. Which diamond colors contribute the most to total sales revenue, and why are mid-range colors like G and H most preferred by consumers?
6. How does the cut quality of diamonds affect their average price, and why does the round cut generate the highest revenue?
7. How do polish and symmetry quality affect diamond pricing, and why are diamonds with excellent craftsmanship more expensive?
8. What is the distribution of diamonds with different clarity levels, and why are diamonds with VS2 and SI1 clarity the most common?
9. What are the ideal proportions for high-value diamonds, and how do length and width affect their value?
10. Is there a correlation between table percentage and depth percentage in diamonds, and how do these factors independently affect diamond design?
11. What are the most popular cuts, colors, and carat weights, and why do round cuts dominate across all categories?

### Interpretations
1. Trend of Cut
The "Round" cut is the most common, far surpassing other cuts like "Oval," "Pear," and "Asscher." The market heavily prefers round-cut diamonds, which likely reflects consumer demand for this classic style.
2. Distribution of Carat Weight
Lower carat weights dominate the distribution, with a steep decline as carat weight increases. Smaller diamonds are more commonly sold, possibly due to affordability and practical preferences.
3. Proportion of Eye-Clean Diamonds Certified by Labs
GIA certifies the overwhelming majority (98.8%) of eye-clean diamonds. GIA is the dominant and most trusted certification authority for high-clarity diamonds, while IGI and HRD play a minimal role.
4. Cut and Clarity Distributions Across Labs
Most diamonds across all clarity grades are certified by GIA. Higher clarity diamonds like VS1 and VVS2 are also common. GIA's stronghold spans all clarity grades, signifying its universal appeal and credibility.
5. Total Sales Revenue by Diamond Color
Diamonds with mid-range colors (like G and H) contribute the most to revenue. Customers prefer diamonds with good balance between quality and price, avoiding extremes in color grading.
6. How Cut Quality Affects Average Price
The "Round" cut generates the highest revenue, with other cuts contributing relatively little. The popularity and higher pricing of round cuts significantly drive their revenue dominance.
7. Reflection of Premiums on Well-Crafted Diamonds (Polish & Symmetry)
Excellent polish and symmetry diamonds command higher prices. Customers pay a premium for diamonds with the finest craftsmanship and aesthetics.
8. Proportion of Diamonds with Different Clarity Levels
VS2 and SI1 clarity diamonds are the most common. Mid-range clarity grades strike a balance between visibility and affordability, attracting more buyers.
9. Ideal Proportions for High-Value Diamonds
Length and width show a proportional relationship for high-value diamonds, with some variation. Customers value well-proportioned diamonds as they align with ideal aesthetic norms.
10. Correlation Between Table Percent and Depth Percent
There is no strong linear relationship between table percentage and depth percentage. These dimensions vary independently, providing room for diverse design preferences.
11. Popularity of Specific Cuts, Colors, and Carat Weights
Round cuts dominate across all colors and weights, while other cuts have limited representation. The round cut is universally appealing across diverse characteristics, reinforcing its popularity.
12. Relation Between Symmetry and Eye-Clean Diamonds
Diamonds with excellent symmetry are sold at higher average prices, particularly for eye-clean diamonds. Symmetry and clarity are crucial quality indicators, significantly influencing diamond pricing.
